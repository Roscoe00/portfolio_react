## About
The aim of this project was to remake my portfolio in React. The previous portfolio was done very early into my learning of html and css. As a result it had no javascript and was incomplete. I decided to keep the styling from that attempt, while adding functionality to the website and improving other aspects like naming and general file structure.

I used my previous portfolios html5 and scss to quickly get to the same point in this project. Only minor changes, such as class names and having break up the portfolio into components, were needed to get a good amount of styling and general layout done.
