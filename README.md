## About
The aim of this project was to remake my portfolio in React to help me get more familiar with its structure and syntax. The previous portfolio was done very early into my learning of html and css. As a result it had no javascript and was incomplete. I decided to keep the styling from that attempt, while adding functionality to the website and improving other aspects like naming and general file structure.

I used my previous portfolios HTML5 and SCSS to quickly get to the same point in this project. Only minor changes, such as class names and having to break up the portfolio into components, were needed to get a good amount of styling and general layout done. So most of the work on this project was adding functionality and responsiveness.

The main challenge of this portfolio was the projects section. I made my own object file to use in a mapping function which generated a card for each project including the image, title and a description. The image also acts as a link directly to the web-page of the given project. I also made arrows to scroll through projects which I thought would be better as I feel getting user input draws more attention to each project. It also makes adding new projects much easier as the page doesn't need to have a new layout if a project is added.

Another important part of the portfolio I'm happy with is the navigation bar. I used React Hash links for the nav bar to get the smooth scrolling effect, which allows me to use a function to stop in a position where the navbar doesnt cover the title of the section its on. 

## Future Fixes
- improve how the projects section displays on bigger screens
- have the pdf icon open/download a copy of my CV
