## About
The aim of this project was to remake my portfolio in React to help me get more familiar with its structure and syntax. The previous portfolio was done very early into my learning of html and css. As a result it had no javascript and was incomplete. I decided to keep the styling from that attempt, while adding functionality to the website and improving other aspects like naming and general file structure.

I used my previous portfolios HTML5 and SCSS to quickly get to the same point in this project. Only minor changes, such as class names and having to break up the portfolio into components, were needed to get a good amount of styling and general layout done. So most of the work on this project was adding functionality and responsiveness.

The main challenge of this portfolio was the projects section. I made my own object file to use in a mapping function which generated a card for each project including the image, title and a description. The image also acts as a link directly to the web-page of the given project. I also made arrows to scroll through projects
